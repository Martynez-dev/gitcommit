    <h1>GIT COMMIT</h1>
    <p>
        Git commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at
        specific times. You should make new commits often, based around logical units of change. Over time, commits should tell a story of 
        the history of your repository and how it came to be the way that it currently is. Commits include lots of metadata in addition to
         the contents  and message, like the author, timestamp, and more.You can however visit <a href="https://instincthub.com/"> instincthub</a>

        <h2>How Git Commit Works</h2>
        <p>
            Commits are the building blocks of "save points" within Git's version control.
        </p>
        <h3>Committing in two phases</h3>
        <p>
            By using commits, you're able to craft history intentionally and safely. You can make commits to different branches, and specify 
            exactly what changes you want to include. Commits are created on the branch that you're currently checked out to  (wherever HEAD is
            ting) so it's always a good idea to run git status before making a commit, to check that you're checked-out to the branch that you
            intend to be.Before you commit, you will need to stage any new changes that you'd like to include in the commit using git add [file]. Commits are lightweight SHA hashes, objects within Git. As long as you're working with text files, you won't need to worry about
             how many files you have, how big they are, or how many commits you make. Git can handle.
